# GitHub Basics for College Projects

## Inroduction

**GitHub** - GitHub is a platform where developers can host and manage their code, collaborate on projects, and track changes over time. It's built around **Git**, 
which is a *version control system* that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without accidentally overwriting each other's work. GitHub makes it 
easy to track versions, manage code history, and collaborate on projects.

## My Goals with GitHub

To learn the fundamentals about version control.

To be handy with GitHub for managing and sharing my projects.

Collaborate effectively with team members on group projects.

Develop good documentation habits for my code and projects.

## Steps I will Take to Get Comfortable with GitHub

*Understand the Basics of Git and GitHub*
Start with understanding the difference between Git and GitHub and learning basic Git commands like git init, git add, git commit, and git push.

*Create and Manage Repositories*
Practice creating repositories, both public and private, to get used to organizing projects on GitHub.

*Learn Branching and Merging*
Explore branching to work on different features without affecting the main project. Learn how to merge branches back into the main codebase once changes are finalized.

*Collaborate on a Project*
Use GitHub in a group project, where I can practice creating pull requests, handling merge conflicts, and reviewing code.

*Familiarize Myself with GitHub Issues and Project Boards*
Get comfortable with GitHubs project management tools to track progress and organize tasks.
